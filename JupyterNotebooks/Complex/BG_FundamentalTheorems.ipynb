    "- The first part says that one of the antiderivatives (also called indefinite integral), say $F$, of some function $f$ may be obtained as the integral of $f$ with a variable bound of integration. This implies that the set of all antiderivatives of $f$ is precisely the set of all functions of the form $F(x) + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n",
    "- The second part states that the definite integral of $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ can be computed by using any one, say $F$, of its infinitely many antiderivatives. This part of the theorem has key practical applications because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by symbolic integration allows for avoiding numerical integration to compute integrals.\n",
