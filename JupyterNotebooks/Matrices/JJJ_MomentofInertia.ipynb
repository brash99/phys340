    "What is a tensor? A tensor is a mathematical object that describes a linear mapping between two vector spaces. So, for example, a 2x2 matrix is a tensor that maps a 2-dimensional vector to another 2-dimensional vector.  In other words, all of the transformation matrices that we have been using are tensors!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are interested in the mapping between the angular momentum vector and the angular velocity vector. The tensor that describes this mapping is called the moment of inertia tensor. The moment of inertia tensor is a 3x3 matrix that is symmetric and positive definite.\n",

    "The total angular momentum of a rigid body, about the origin, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{L} = \\sum_i m_i \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{v}_i$$\n",

    "where $\\vec{r}_i$ is the position vector of the $i$th particle relative to the origin, and $\\vec{v}_i$ is the velocity vector of the $i$th particle relative to the origin.  We can write the velocity as the cross product of the angular velocity and the position vector:\n",
    "\n",
